# Welcome to my first one small step for man on GitHub!
 
## What is TINSITS? 
### It is undisclosed (yet) my project on Unity3D

## Is it game?
### Mostly not. It's started like small prototype of basic idea, but... it became a big opportunity to raise my skills as Software Engineer. By and large it is concept of how to make Unity Projects design. For now, i'd say, it's a game prototype. 

## When TINSITS started?
### Official start date is 2022.09.01 (1st of September)

## What TINSITS stands for?
### Secretly secret mystery riddle acronym!

## What is MOpus?
### MOpus is an extraction of all my code from TINSITS Unity Project. I am using VS2022, so... 

## What is the purpose of MOpus?
### To be a reference base for examples of various solutions in the code, particularly in projects for Unity.

## So, is it fished or not?
### Definitely not. TINSITS itself, I believe, is in grayboxing stage. There are a lot of things to do. All production was concentrated on code base. And now I have pretty solid Core. Still, I have massive tech debt... When I developing this project - this project is developing me.
